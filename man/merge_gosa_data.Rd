\title{Merge GOSA subgroup and grade data}
\usage{
merge_gosa_data(subgroup_df, grade_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{subgroup_df}{Subgroup enrollment data}

\item{grade_df}{Grade-level enrollment data}
}
\value{
Merged data frame with grade-level enrollment counts
}
\description{
The grade data has multiple rows per entity (one per grade level),
while subgroup data has one row per entity. Merging would cause
row explosion. For now, we pivot grade data to wide format to
add grade-level enrollment columns to the subgroup data.
